# Install Playwright browsers and system dependencies.
#
# Manual changes to Dockerfile.playwright will be reverted every time ddev
# start is run. In general, edit this file instead.
#
# We want to install whatever browsers are used by the currently locked version
# of playwright in the package.json for this project. What this does is:
#
# 1. Creates a copy of the playwright directory in the image. We need this
#    because Playwright keeps a hidden .links/<hash> file with the path of
#    what browsers are installed by what apps. Without it, Playwright will re-
#    download browsers even though they are in the directory. As the Docker
#    context is the web-build directory, we have a pre-start hook in
#    config.yaml that copies in the current test files.
# 2. $username doesn't work in --mount... lines as it's a shell variable set by
#    ddev. Instead, we mount the .cache cache into /dot-cache, and symlink it
#    in.
# 3. Then we remove the symlink, and copy the cache directory into ~/.cache so
#    it is persisted in the image.
#
# See https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/4727.
